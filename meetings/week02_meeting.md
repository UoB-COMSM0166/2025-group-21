## 3 GAME SHORTLIST

### 1. Penguin Game

#### Inspiration:

<a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-learn-to-fly">Learn to fly</a>

#### Premise:

The penguin is one of the only flightless birds. It's your job to help him fulfil his dream. Help him build up speed and get him upgrades to try record the longest flight time (time and distance).

#### Fundamentals:

Game begins by sliding down a large ice ramp. It's your job to help him retain velocity and air time. Focus on physics; gravity, friction, wind resistance, velocity etc. Controlled movement along the Y axis, with background moving right to left. 

Ranges of ramps / slopes area generated as you move, with downward momentum on the ramps being used to generate velocity. Hitting the ramps at the wrong angle causes a loss of velocity.

A range of interferences try to stop you or slow you down; sharks jumping out of the water, birds, planes, satellites in the sky, 

In between rounds, you can upgrade your character with items using in game currency generated on a score based system.

**Minimum Viable Product:**

Ramp based movement game
Item / perk upgrade system
Highscore recording
In game interactions; enemies, bonuses, boons

**Extensions:**

Parallax effect of foreground to background
Bonus / multiplier system
Design of items
Changing scenery

### 2. Rocket Game

#### Inspiration:

<a href="https://www.silvergames.com/en/into-space">Into Space</a>

#### Premise:

The player tries to escape Earth's atmosphere and get into space with a rocket. The player can make upgrades to their rocket using in-game currency. This can be collected on each attempt flight where it is aquired per increase in altitude as well as by the rocket (floating coins in the atmosphere). The flight ends when the rocket runs out of fuel or an obstical us hit. 

#### Basic Game Flow:

Game begins with initial flight with the default starting rocket (no upgrades). Between each flight, the player is taken to the workshop (upgrades screen) where they can choose which parts or attributes to upgrade. Upgrades include: 

  - Hull
  - Fins
  - Engine
  - Fuel tank
  - Boosters

  - Better coin economy
  - Better fuel consumption
  - Better aerodynamics
  - Better damage protection

The players will achieve a higher altitude as they aquire more upgrades to their rocket. Game concludes once the player has reached aspecific altitude.

#### In-Game Mechanics:

- Constant downwards gravitational force that is counteracted with increasing successas the rocket is upgraded
- Trajectory of rocket is affected by wind and rocket can be manoeuvred left/right with arrow keys. Manoeuvrability increases with upgrades.
- Rocket health bar is depleted if an obstacle (e.g. UFO) is hit.
