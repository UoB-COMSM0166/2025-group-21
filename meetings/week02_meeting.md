#### Inspiration:

<a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-learn-to-fly">Learn to fly</a>

#### Premise:

The penguin is one of the only flightless birds. It's your job to help him fulfil his dream. Help him build up speed and get him upgrades to try record the longest flight time (time and distance).

#### Fundamentals:

Game begins by sliding down a large ice ramp. It's your job to help him retain velocity and air time. Focus on physics; gravity, friction, wind resistance, velocity etc. Controlled movement along the Y axis, with background moving right to left. 

Ranges of ramps / slopes area generated as you move, with downward momentum on the ramps being used to generate velocity. Hitting the ramps at the wrong angle causes a loss of velocity.

A range of interferences try to stop you or slow you down; sharks jumping out of the water, birds, planes, satellites in the sky, 

In between rounds, you can upgrade your character with items using in game currency generated on a score based system.

**Minimum Viable Product:**

Ramp based movement game
Item / perk upgrade system
Highscore recording
In game interactions; enemies, bonuses, boons

**Extensions:**

Parallax effect of foreground to background
